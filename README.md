# Digital Technologies Experiment Repository

This repository contains the platform code used to run an economic experiment on the effects of digital technology on academic outcomes and student experience.

This was an experiment done for the completion of the Bachelor of Economics Honours year at the University of Queensland.

The platform uses the Django (Python) web framework which can be hosted in a website. We hosted the website in Amazon Web Services.

In the platform, participants enter a session id that gives them access to a specific session. Once started the platform guides them through the instructions, consent forms, allocation to a content treatment, quiz, survey and payment screen.

The platform has a built in researcher panel to run the experiment, retrieve the filled forms, retrieve the data and see the results of each session.
